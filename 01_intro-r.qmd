library(ggplot2)
interviews <- readr::read_csv(here("data/SAFI_clean.csv"))

## Why R? {.center}

. . .

It's a programming language/software that is **FREE** and open source! 🎉

. . .

It was created by statisticians for statistics 📊

. . .

Because it's **FREE** and open source and works with scripts, it's great for reproducibility 💪

. . .

Did I mention **FREE**?


## Ok... So why RStudio? {.center}

. . .

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE)

. . .

It's essentially a (much prettier) wrapper for the R software

. . .

R is integrated into RStudio, so you never actually have to open R[, which is a good thing...]{.fragment}

## Basics of R {.center}

R is a language spoken by the R software

Software can be very 'dumb'

So we need to learn it's language to communicate EXACTLY
what we want

And like learning any language, this requires practice!

Things to look forward to:

```{r}
#| label: example-plot
#| echo: false
interviews_plotting %>% 
   ggplot(aes(x = no_membrs, y = number_items, color = village)) +
   geom_count() +
   theme_minimal()
```

---

Things to look forward to:

```{r}
#| label: example-plot3
#| echo: true
percent_items %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = village, y = percent, fill = items)) +
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
    facet_wrap(~ items) +
    theme_bw() +
    theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
          legend.position = "none")
```

## Exercise 1

⏰ **5 mins**

Create two variables `r_length` and `r_width` and assign them values.

Create a third variable `r_area` and give it a value by multiplying `r_length`
and `r_width`.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution

```{r}
r_length <- 6
r_width <- 7
r_area <- r_length * r_width
```


## Exercise 2

⏰ **5 mins**

Type `?round` into the **console** to open the help page for the `round()` function.

Find the appropriate function to round `1.624` down to the nearest integer.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution

```{r}
floor(1.624)
```


## Exercise 3 {.smaller .scrollable}

⏰ **10 mins**

What will happen in each of the examples below?

💡 **Hint:** use `typeof()` to check the data type of your objects

```{r}
num_char <- c(1, 2, 3, "a")
num_logical <- c(1, 2L, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
tricky <- c(1, 2, 3, "4")
```

Why does this happen?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution

Vectors can only contain a single data type.

R converts to a common denominator that loses as little information
as possible.

character < double < integer < logical

```{r exercise-3-sol}
num_char
num_logical
char_logical
tricky
```


## Exercise 4

⏰ **5 mins**

How many values in `combined_logical` are `"TRUE"` (as a string)?

```{r}
#| label: exercise-4
num_logical <- c(1, 2, 3, TRUE)
char_logical <- c("a", "b", "c", TRUE)
combined_logical <- c(num_logical, char_logical)
```

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution

```{r exercise-4-sol}
combined_logical
```

The `TRUE` in `num_logical` gets converted to `1`, and then `"1"` when combined
with `char_logical`.


## Exercise 5 {.smaller}

⏰ **10 mins**

1. Using this vector of rooms, create a new vector with the NAs removed:

```{r exercise-5}
rooms <- c(1, 2, 1, NA, 3, 1, 3, 2, 8, NA, 1)
```

2. then calculate the `median`.

3. Use R to calculate how many elements of `rooms` are larger than 2.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution

```{r exercise-5-sol}
# 1
rooms_no_na <- rooms[!is.na(rooms)]
# or
rooms_no_na <- na.omit(rooms)

# 2
median(rooms, na.rm = TRUE) # or median(rooms_no_na)

# 3
rooms_above_2 <- rooms_no_na[rooms_no_na > 2]
length(rooms_above_2)
```
