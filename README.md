# Slides for Data Carpentry workshops

Slides on the R-related topics. These are templates for each episode.

## Usage

```sh
git clone git@github.com:bbartholdy/data-carpentry-slides.git
```

1. Create a new branch (e.g. 2406-DC-LDEV)
2. Modify the slide *.qmd* files, and remove those not needed
3. Checkout the README.md file from a previous workshop branch and update (`git checkout <branch> README.md`)
4. Switch the GitHub pages deployment to the new branch (Settings > Pages > Build and deployment)
5. Commit with a tag and create a new release from the branch

If there are major changes to slides, this should be done to the main
branch (e.g., changes to the Data Carpentry materials).
