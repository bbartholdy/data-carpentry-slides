## What is Quarto? {.smaller}

Quarto is a free, open-source scientific and technical publishing system.

Quarto allows you to **seamlessly combine executable R code, its output, and text** in a single document.

These documents **can be converted to multiple static and dynamic output formats**, including PDF (.pdf), Word (.docx), and HTML (.html).

The benefit of a well-prepared Quarto document is **full reproducibility**.

## Why Quarto?

Full reproducibility also means

- flexibility to add data and recompile
- no need to change all occurrences in a document
- easily fix mistakes made during analysis...

# Quarto Exercises {.center .inverse}


## Exercise 1 {.inverse .smaller}

⏰ **4 mins**

Play around with the different options in the chunk with the code for the table,
and re-Render to see what each option does to the output.

What happens if you use `eval: false` and `echo: false`? 

What is the difference between this and `include: false`?

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, color_running_background  = "lightgreen", color_running_text = "black", color_finished_background = "red", color_finished_text =  "grey30")`

. . .

### Solution {.inverse}

Create a chunk with `eval: false, echo: false`

then create another chunk with `include: false` to compare. 

`eval: false, echo: false` will neither run the code in the chunk, nor show the
code in the rendered document. The code chunk essentially doesn’t exist in the
rendered document...

...whereas `include: false` will run the code and store the output for later use.
