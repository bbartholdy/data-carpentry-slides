## Data frames and tibbles {.center}

Data frames can contain multiple data types.

Each column in a data frame must only contain one type.

A tibble is a type of data frame used by the 📦{tidyverse} packages.

## Absolute file paths {.center}

The location of a file on your computer.

A file in your home directory may be

`C:\User\bagginsf\there-and-back-again.docx`

or

`~/there-and-back-again.docx`

depending on your OS. These are **absolute paths**.


## Relative file paths

On the left is a scary spooky forest, with spiderwebs and gnarled trees, with file paths written on the branches like “~/mmm/nope.csv” and “setwd(“/haha/good/luck/”), with a scared looking cute fuzzy monster running out of it. On the right is a bright, colorful path with flowers, rainbow and sunshine, with signs saying “here!” and “it’s all right here!” A monster facing away from us in a backpack and walking stick is looking toward the right path. Stylized text reads “here: find your path.”'}

With the 📦{here} package combined with an RStudio project we can use **relative paths**.

This means we start the file path at the root of the project, and don't have to
worry about anything that comes before.

So if our data file is stored in a folder called `data`, the file path will be
`./data/mydata.csv`

where `.` is the project root.

Relative paths are useful when collaborating on projects. Imagine sharing a
script that loads data from `C:/This/path/only/exists/for/me.csv`

## Exercise 1 {.inverse .smaller .scrollable}


1. Create a tibble (`interviews_100`) containing only the data in row 100 of the interviews dataset.

Now, continue using interviews for each of the following activities:

2. Notice how `nrow()` gave you the number of rows in the tibble?
  - Use that number to pull out just that last row in the tibble.
  - Compare that with what you see as the last row using `tail()` to make sure it’s meeting expectations.
  - Pull out that last row using `nrow()` instead of the row number.
  - Create a new tibble (`interviews_last`) from that last row.
3. Using the number of rows in the interviews dataset that you found in question 2, extract the row that is in the middle of the dataset. Store the content of this middle row in an object named `interviews_middle`. (hint: This dataset has an odd number of rows. Use the `median()` function and what you’ve learned about sequences in R to extract the middle row!)
4. Combine `nrow()` with the `-` notation to reproduce the behavior of `head(interviews)`, keeping just the first through 6th rows of the interviews dataset.


## Solution {.center}

```{r}
## 1.
interviews_100 <- interviews[100, ]
## 2.
# Saving `n_rows` to improve readability and reduce duplication
n_rows <- nrow(interviews)
interviews_last <- interviews[n_rows, ]
## 3.
interviews_middle <- interviews[median(1:n_rows), ]
## 4.
interviews_head <- interviews[-(7:n_rows), ]
```


## Exercise 2 {.inverse .center}

- Rename the levels of the factor to have the first letter in uppercase: "No", "Undetermined", and "Yes".

- Now that we have renamed the factor level to "Undetermined", can you recreate the barplot such that "Undetermined" is last (after "Yes")?


## Solution {.inverse .center}

```{r}
#| label: setup-solution-2

memb_assoc <- interviews$memb_assoc
```


```{r}
## Rename levels
memb_assoc <- fct_recode(memb_assoc, No = "no",
                         Undetermined = "undetermined", Yes = "yes")
## Reorder levels. Note we need to use the new level names.
memb_assoc <- factor(memb_assoc, levels = c("No", "Yes", "Undetermined"))
plot(memb_assoc)
```


## Questions {.center}

See if you can answer these questions

- What is a data.frame?
- How can I read a complete csv file into R?
- How can I get basic summary information about my dataset?
- How can I change the way R treats strings in my dataset?
- Why would I want strings to be treated differently?
- How are dates represented in R and how can I change the format?
